      "Netflix: 'High probability' streamer will raise prices, analyst says Netflix (NFLX) is a member of the top 7 tech stocks - also known as the Magnificent Seven - that have been closely watched by investors. The tech sector has fallen from its peak earlier this year, paving the way for speculation over whether tech stocks are still a sound investment. Mark Mahaney, Evercore ISI Senior Managing Director and Head of Internet Research, joins Yahoo Finance to discuss Netflix's outlook after a recent report from the Wall Street Journal stated the streaming service's intent to raise subscription prices after the SAG-AFTRA strike ends. Mahaney comments on Netflix's move into AVOD (advertising on demand), stating: \"Over time, it will help them gain more subscribers, and the beauty of this is with the advertising revenue, they could drop their subscription price by a couple of bucks, three bucks, and generate more revenue per user, like you rarely see that in business history.\" For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live. : <class 'str'>\n",

      "Hollywood strikes have cost the US economy 45,000 jobs since May The US economy added a stunning 336,000 jobs in September, nearly double the 170,000 economists surveyed by Bloomberg had expected — but the Hollywood strikes registered yet another hit to the jobs report last month as the writers strike reached its conclusion while the actors strike is still ongoing. According to data released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics Friday morning, employment in motion picture and sound recording industries decreased by another 7,000 after falling by 17,000 in August, \"reflecting the impact of labor disputes.\" Since the strikes first began in May, employment in those industries has declined by 45,000. Striking Hollywood actors will meet with studios again on Friday as the two sides restart negotiations on the heels of an epic conclusion to the writers strike last week. SAG-AFTRA — the union that represents approximately 160,000 actors, announcers, recording artists, and other media professionals around the world — began a strike on July 14 after failing to negotiate a deal with the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP), which bargains on behalf of the major studios including Warner Bros. (WBD), Disney (DIS), Netflix (NFLX), Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NBCUniversal (CMCSA), Paramount (PARA), and Sony (SONY). Similarly to the writers, SAG-AFTRA is fighting for more protections surrounding the role of artificial intelligence in media and entertainment in addition to better pay, improved working conditions, and higher streaming residuals as more movies and TV shows go directly to streaming. The writers union, Writers Guild of America (WGA), had been on strike for nearly 150 days prior to its studio deal. The guild was successful in achieving many of its demands, which included increased regulations surrounding the use of artificial intelligence, minimum staffing requirements, a boost to streaming residuals, and more. Industry watchers largely expect SAG-AFTRA to reach a similar conclusion, although the union made it clear that, while it will review the WGA's agreement, the guild is ultimately committed to reaching a deal that's specific to its member base. According to estimates from the Los Angeles County Economic Development Corp., the 2007-2008 writers strike cost the Los Angeles County economy a whopping $2.5 billion. That likely will double this time around. Kevin Klowden, chief global strategist at the Milken Institute, estimated the nearly five-month-long writers strike, coupled with the ongoing actors strike, will cost the national economy $5 billion-plus. \"The main thing we're really factoring into it is the lost wages,\" Klowden previously told Yahoo Finance Live. Klowden noted California will be impacted, but also other popular filming locations like New York, Atlanta, Albuquerque, and Pittsburgh. Alexandra Canal is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

      "Is Trending Stock Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) a Buy Now? Amazon (AMZN) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term. Shares of this online retailer have returned -8.6% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -5.2% change. The Zacks Internet - Commerce industry, to which Amazon belongs, has lost 8.6% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term? Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision. Earnings Estimate Revisions Rather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings. Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements. For the current quarter, Amazon is expected to post earnings of $0.58 per share, indicating a change of +190% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the last 30 days. For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $2.23 points to a change of +214.1% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has remained unchanged. For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.08 indicates a change of +38.2% from what Amazon is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged. With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) for Amazon. The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate: 12 Month EPS Revenue Growth Forecast While earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth. For Amazon, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $141.89 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +11.6%. For the current and next fiscal years, $570.79 billion and $644.42 billion estimates indicate +11.1% and +12.9% changes, respectively. Last Reported Results and Surprise History Amazon reported revenues of $134.38 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +10.9%. EPS of $0.63 for the same period compares with $0.10 a year ago. Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $131.54 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +2.16%. The EPS surprise was +85.29%. Over the last four quarters, Amazon surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period. Valuation No investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance. Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is. As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued. Amazon is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade. Bottom Line The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Amazon. However, its Zacks Rank #1 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term. Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?
