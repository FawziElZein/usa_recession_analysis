(WBD), Disney (DIS), Netflix (NFLX), Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NBCUniversal (CMCSA), Paramount (PARA), and Sony (SONY).\\nSimilarly to the writers, SAG-AFTRA is fighting for more protections surrounding the role of artificial intelligence in media and entertainment in addition to better pay, improved working conditions, and higher streaming residuals as more movies and TV shows go directly to streaming.\\nThe writers union, Writers Guild of America (WGA), had been on strike for nearly 150 days prior to its studio deal. The guild was successful in achieving many of its demands, which included increased regulations surrounding the use of artificial intelligence, minimum staffing requirements, a boost to streaming residuals, and more.\\nIndustry watchers largely expect SAG-AFTRA to reach a similar conclusion, although the union made it clear that, while it will review the WGA\\'s agreement, the guild is ultimately committed to reaching a deal that\\'s specific to its member base.\\nAccording to estimates from the Los Angeles County Economic Development Corp., the 2007-2008 writers strike cost the Los Angeles County economy a whopping $2.5 billion.

       "  \"Is Trending Stock Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) a Buy Now?\\nAmazon (AMZN) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.\\nShares of this online retailer have returned -8.6% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -5.2% change. The Zacks Internet - Commerce industry, to which Amazon belongs, has lost 8.6% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\\nFor the current quarter, Amazon is expected to post earnings of $0.58 per share, indicating a change of +190% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $2.23 points to a change of +214.1% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has remained unchanged.\\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.08 indicates a change of +38.2% from what Amazon is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.\\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) for Amazon.\\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\\n12 Month EPS\\nRevenue Growth Forecast\\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\\nFor Amazon, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $141.89 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +11.6%. For the current and next fiscal years, $570.79 billion and $644.42 billion estimates indicate +11.1% and +12.9% changes, respectively.\\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\\nAmazon reported revenues of $134.38 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +10.9%. EPS of $0.63 for the same period compares with $0.10 a year ago.\\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $131.54 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +2.16%. The EPS surprise was +85.29%.\\nOver the last four quarters, Amazon surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.\\nValuation\\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\\nAmazon is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\\nBottom Line\\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Amazon. However, its Zacks Rank #1 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.\\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The Future Is Battery-Powered Electric Cars\\nOzempic Is Making People Buy Less Food, Walmart Says\\nThe test satellites are set to take off on United Launch Alliance’s Atlas V workhorse rocket in Florida at 2 p.m. local time. Dubbed the “protoflight” mission, the satellites, which Amazon hoped to have in space a year ago, are meant to test out the company’s ability to beam broadband internet from orbit.\\nIt’ll be the first in-flight test of Amazon’s ambitious Project Kuiper initiative, on which it’s pledged to spend more than $10 billion.\\nSimilar to SpaceX’s Starlink, Kuiper aims to blanket the globe with 3,236 satellites in low-Earth orbit. Customers who purchase small user terminals, unveiled by Amazon in March, will be able to send and receive signals from future Kuiper satellites.\\nRead More: How Musk’s Starlink Sparked a New Kind of Space Race: QuickTake\\nKuiper is just one of many broadband megaconstellations that are planned for this decade, but it aims to become only the second operational service for individual consumers after Starlink.\\nStarlink has shown there is a market for low latency internet-from-space. But it’s unclear how profitable the direct-to-consumer segment is and whether Amazon can make it work.\\n“Everyone’s sort of assuming that because SpaceX can do these things, everyone else can do them too,” Brian Weeden, director of program planning for the Secure World Foundation, a space sustainability nonprofit, said. “Managing constellations of thousands – it’s plausible that someone else can do it, but not yet proven.”\\nAmazon declined to comment on the launch beyond a blog post about the mission. SpaceX did not respond to a request for comment.\\nEager to Launch\\nThis launch has been a moving target for Amazon, with this pair of satellites — called KuiperSat-1 and KuiperSat-2 — originally slated to launch on a rocket built by ABL Space Systems as early as a year ago. But that startup’s rocket failed in its initial launch, and subsequent delays with ULA’s Vulcan sent Amazon in search of another option to get to space sooner.\\n“Mighty Atlas is hard down on the pad for tomorrow’s Kuiper Demo launch,” ULA’s CEO Tory Bruno said in a social-media post, referring to the rocket that will carry the satellites being set at the launch pad for further preparations.\\nThe change in rides reflects Amazon’s eagerness to begin launching Project Kuiper. Amazon has yet to begin manufacturing and launching its satellites in bulk, while SpaceX continues to loft batches of its Starlink satellites into orbit with increasing frequency. It has nearly 5,000 active satellites in orbit.\\nAmazon needs to have half of its planned constellation in orbit by mid-2026 to be in compliance with its license under the Federal Communications Commission, which regulates frequencies for communicating with satellites.\\nHighlighting Amazon’s haste is the fact that the company has reserved an entire Atlas V rocket to launch these two small test satellites to space. Each Kuiper satellite is estimated to weigh between 1,300 and 1,500 pounds (589 and 680 kilograms), according to research from space advisory firm Quilty Space, previously Quilty Analytics LLC. That means Kuipersat-1 and 2 are dwarfed by the Atlas V’s powerful launch capability, which can send as much as 44,000 pounds (19,958 kilograms) of cargo to low-Earth orbit.\\n“Launching two small satellites on a heavy-lift rocket is overkill, unless the circumstances are dire,” said Caleb Henry, director of research at Quilty Space.\\nUncertain Road\\nThis pivotal launch comes at a time of change for Jeff Bezos’ separate rocket company, Blue Origin. On Sept. 25, Blue Origin said CEO Bob Smith would be replaced with Amazon executive David Limp, whose team oversees Kuiper.\\nIn 2022, Amazon inked contracts for as many as 83 rocket launches to deploy Kuiper satellites from three different providers in what was the largest commercial procurement of launch vehicles in history.\\nThe multibillion-dollar launch contract included flights on Blue Origin’s New Glenn, Arianespace’s Ariane 6, and ULA’s Vulcan. All three vehicles have yet to launch to orbit, with Vulcan targeting December for its first flight.\\nWhile Amazon has purchased as many as nine Atlas V launches, it’s an open question if Amazon can get its satellites into space fast enough.\\nA company shareholder sued Amazon in August alleging the company cost itself millions of dollars because it didn’t consider SpaceX’s affordable Falcon 9 rocket due to the rivalry between Bezos and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk. At the time, an Amazon spokesperson said “the claims in this lawsuit are completely without merit, and we look forward to showing that through the legal process.”\\n“You’ve got to get thousands of satellites up in orbit, and right now, there’s really only one way to do that,” Weeden said. “And that’s SpaceX.”\\nSpace Internet\\nIt’s unclear what the market will look like by the time Kuiper is operating. Henry, of Quilty Space, said Amazon may have another opportunity to find customers by offering its cloud-computing services through Kuiper.\\n“They have a potential advantage in being able to serve their own cloud business and basically enhance that along with the other services that they provide,” said Henry.\\nWill there be enough customers to share? SpaceX said it recently surpassed 2 million active customers. That eclipses the biggest players in satellite internet, Henry said.\\nBut that number pales in comparison to major terrestrial broadband suppliers. And while the consumer market is vital to Starlink’s core business, SpaceX has put in significant effort to sell Starlink services to higher-paying businesses and governments, recently receiving its first US Space Force contract.\\n“The question here is how many people actually can afford the prices they are charging for this internet,” Weeden said, “Especially when you exempt all the people that have really good wired broadband in most of the developed world and big cities.”\\n(Updates with ULA CEO comment in 10th paragraph.)\\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\\nAftermath of an Assassination: Inside the India-Canada Crisis\\nCan AI Beat the Market?

All but one of the remaining deliveries are scheduled for next year.\\nFreightWaves reporting last month foreshadowed that San Bernardino would be the initial destination for the new freighter because it is home to Amazon’s new West Coast regional hub and the plane was temporarily stationed there while the new crews and ground personnel made themselves familiar with the aircraft.\\nAmazon has said the A330s will operate in its domestic network and replace aging 767-200 freighters as their leases expire. ABX Air and Air Transport International, owned by Air Transport Services Group, and Atlas Air fly the 767s for Amazon.\\nThe A330 has about 20% more volume and is more fuel-efficient than the 767 family of aircraft. It has nearly as much capacity as a Boeing 777.\\nAmazon uses its air logistics network to meet one- and two-day delivery promises for eligible Prime members.\\nHawaiian Airlines’ experience operating A330 passenger aircraft gave it a leg up for the new Amazon flying contract. Hawaiian is hiring about 160 new pilots to support the Amazon cargo operation and will also carry out routine maintenance on the A330 aircraft.\\nThe online retail giant’s flight activity has slowed considerably this year as e-commerce sales normalize following a pandemic-era boom, but modest growth stands in contrast to the flight pullbacks at FedEx and UPS. Amazon Air confirmed this week that it will no longer use Leipzig/Halle airport in Germany as one of its European hubs.\\nAmazon has more than 100 aircraft in its global fleet.\\nClick here for more FreightWaves/American Shipper stories by Eric Kulisch.\\nTwitter: @ericreports / LinkedIn: Eric Kulisch / ekulisch@freightwaves.com\\nRELATED NEWS:\\nHawaiian Airlines sees advantage in Amazon pivot to Airbus freighter\\nAmazon downsizes cargo operations at German airport\\nFedEx air fleet flies more in August\\nHawaiian Airlines preps for October start of Amazon cargo service\\nThe post Amazon’s largest cargo jet makes debut appeared first on FreightWaves.'],\n",

       "  'Growth in AI, the cloud means tech stocks are \\'going up\\': Analyst\\nHigher for longer interest rates and surging treasury bond yields have made investors, of all sectors, nervous. However, with increasing interest and innovations in AI and the cloud from tech giants - like Microsoft (MSFT) and Amazon (AMZN) - some investors are looking towards the tech sector for potential future profits. Wedbush Managing Director Scott Devitt joins Yahoo Finance to discuss what he thinks about opportunities in the tech sector despite worries of a recession.\\nDevitt defends his bullish outlook, saying \"these companies have proven themselves in terms of continuing to be secular growth stories. We have another cycle that we\\'re in the first inning of in AI, and so we\\'re very optimistic on the group overall.\" When it comes to companies that best stand to benefit from generative AI, Devitt points to Amazon and Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG) are the clearest beneficiaries, but also companies like Booking Holdings (BKNG) which could benefit from how AI can enhance the company\\'s offerings.\\nFor more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.\\nJOSH LIPTON: Surging bond yields are making investors nervous, including, of course, tech investors, but our next guest says he\\'s using the macro and Fed worries as a time to double down on his bullish tech thesis and not panic. Joining us now to talk about this is Scott Devitt from Wedbush. Scott, great to see you.\\nSCOTT DEVITT: Hey, Josh. How are you doing?\\nJOSH LIPTON: So, Scott, let me just start right with the big story for investors right now, those surging bond yields, and typically, of course, Scott, you would think that\\'s a headwind for tech, for growth-oriented stocks. Do you think tech stocks, can they work, Scott, against that backdrop?\\nSCOTT DEVITT: Probably not. I think that you\\'re going to need-- you\\'re going to need, you know, the combination of rates and oil to decline and some, you know, less pressure on the economy to get growth stocks to really start to work again. In an environment where rates are rising, so the scenario in the segment that preceded me in terms of jobs report being strong, the economy remaining hot, you know, I think that\\'s a knee-jerk reaction that\\'s negative.\\nEven though a stronger economy for a long period of time could mean greater growth and greater profits for growth companies, I think just the surprise around that and the pricing end of that initially would be negative. But our view is that, ultimately, we\\'re closer to the end, very close to the end of the rate increases, and that when we get to the other side of that, whether that\\'s imminent or in coming months or coming quarters, it\\'s going to be a strong tailwind for growth stocks.\\nJULIE HYMAN: So in other words, Scott-- it\\'s Julie here. In other words, even if there\\'s a little pain to come, if you\\'re interested in tech stocks, you should buy them here, wait it out, and then sooner rather than later, whether it\\'s weeks, months, you will have that rebound that you\\'re talking about.\\nSCOTT DEVITT: Well, I think coming out of the pandemic, you know, there was a case being made that that these large growth companies were at secular maturity, and you had a very weak year in 2022 for stock performance, and I think these businesses have proven that they\\'re resilient, that the underlying growth is still there, and that \\'22 was more of a digestion period on the back of the pandemic.\\nAnd in addition to that, you have an AI cycle which is just beginning, and so I think that whether we go down first or we go straight up, we\\'re going up, because these companies have proven themselves in terms of continuing to be secular growth stories, and we have another cycle that we\\'re in the first inning of in AI, and so we\\'re very optimist on the group overall across my coverage and internet, as well as the broader tech team at Wedbush.\\nJOSH LIPTON: And, Scott, you mentioned there AI, and, of course, big tech\\'s been putting a lot of time, effort, and money into that technology. I\\'m interested, Scott, in your coverage universe, what are the names that you think are best positioned to monetize generative AI?\\nSCOTT DEVITT: So I think, first and foremost, it would be Amazon and Alphabet. You know, Amazon because of the cloud business and the ability to integrate services into their their cloud offering that corporates adopt that then creates a monetization cycle for AWS, and similarly Google\\'s compute engine as well in its business. So those two companies to me are the clearest beneficiaries of this next coming cycle.\\nBut companies that are not quite as obvious like booking.com in terms of targeting and other features and functionality that can be expanded because of the use of large language models, I think that will come with time, but where we are in the cycle right now is NVIDIA is making all the money. Everyone\\'s buying the chips, and it\\'s going to go from the chips to the cloud providers figuring out how to monetize the use of those chips, and then in coming years, it\\'ll be more clear and evident which consumer companies benefit.\\nI have the the joy of covering companies like Amazon and Alphabet that cross over those two, so it will be the corporate enterprise side of Amazon and Alphabet that show it first, but when you look at the consumer businesses as well, in the latter portion of this cycle, I think you\\'re going to see their ability to monetize there as well.'],\n",
